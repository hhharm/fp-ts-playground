# Part one. Eq, Ord, Semigroup (+ contramap), Monoid, Category, Functor

https://dev.to/gcanti/series/680 - the fp-ts author articles cycle.

This is extremely short conspect:

## 1. Eq and Ord
Eq are for comprasion and sorting. If you have typescript object, you can use contramap function to transform object to some primitive which already has Eq and Ord.

``` typescript
export declare const contramap: <A, B>(f: (b: B) => A) => (fa: Eq<A>) => Eq<B>

interface User {
  readonly key: string;
  readonly firstName: string;
  readonly lastName: string;
}

// it is says to compare two users using their 'key' field
// this is similar to 'trackBy' function in Angular
const eqUserByKey: Eq<User> = pipe(
  eqUUID,
  contramap((user) => user.key)
)
```



## 2. Semigroup
Semigroup is a type with operation that is associative. For the easiness such operation is always called *concat*, though it can be anything.

```typescript
interface Semigroup<A> {
    concat: (x: A, y: A) => A
}
```

#### e.g.
```typescript
type A = {concat: (a: number, b: number) => a - b}
type B = {concat: (a: string, b: string) = `${a} ${b}`}
```

because concat(concat(a,b), c) = concat(a, concat(b,c))

## 3. Monoid

+ Shortly: Monoid is a Semigroup with neutral (*empty*) element.

```typescript
interface Monoid<A> extends Semigroup<A> {
   readonly empty: A
}
```
+ More detailed: Monoid is a type with operation that is associative and has neutral element. Neutral element is an element for which two things are true:
``` 
Right identity: concat(x, empty) = x, for all x in A
Left identity: concat(empty, x) = x, for all x in A
```

#### e.g.
- for number and + operation empty element is 0. because x + 0 = x for any number
- for number and multiplication operation empty element is 1. x multiply 1 = x for any number

### 4. Category 

Category is a pair of object and functions that changes them.
> A category is a pair (Objects, Morphisms) where:
> Objects is a collection of objects
> Morphisms is a collection of morphisms (or arrows) between the objects
>
> In Typescript:
> + objects are all the TypeScript types: string, number, Array<string>, ...
> + morphisms are all the TypeScript functions: (a: A) => B, (b: B) => C, ... where A, B, C, ... are TypeScript types
> + identity morphisms are all encoded as a single polymorphic function const identity = <A>(a: A): A => a
> + composition of morphisms is the usual function composition (which is associative)" (c)

### 5. Functions can be pure and 'effectful' (with side effects)

gcanty writes it this way:
```typescript
const f = <A,B> (a: A): F<B> => { //effectful function }
const g = <B,C> (b: B): C => { //pure function }
```
   
where `F<B>` is a result that has side effects - e.g. it may fail, or it may be async, or it may return undetermine number of results (array or list).

If functions were always pure, programms could be just composition of functions, e.g g(f()), but because of side effects it's not possible.

### 6. Composition of functions 
   Composition of functions A and B is calling a function B with result of function A:
   `a(b())`

### 7. Functor 
  + Very shortly: Functor is a type that has map function and object.
  
```typescript
export interface Functor<F> {
   readonly URI: F
   readonly map: <A, B>(fa: HKT<F, A>, f: (a: A) => B) => HKT<F, B>
}
```

+ Functor is a thing that helps to compose 'effectful' (with side effect) functions.
To do composition, gcanty defines 'lift' function that does  mapping. Simply saying, it is map function that helps to treat function with side effect as a simple object.
  
+ Formal defenition of effectful function:
  > We call effectful program a function with the following signature `(a: A) => F<B>`
  
  > Such a signature models a program which accepts an input of type A and yields a result of type B,
  > along with an effect F, where F is some type constructor.
  > Recall that a [type constructor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_constructor) is an n-ary type operator taking as argument zero or more types, and returning another type.
 
Translating to the simple language, this means that effectful function is a function `(a: A) => F<B>`, where `F<B>` means some type constructed from B but not exactly B.
  
  Some examples:
  a) Function that read DB and return item that may be missing
  ```typescript
  const getItemFromDb = (a: A): B | null => {/*some code*/}
  ```
  b) Function that does network call
  ```typescript
  const createItemByNetwork = (a: A): Promise<B> => {/*some code*/}
  ```
  c) Function that parses string and returns strings array. It is effectful because `Array<B>` is also type constructor
  ```
  const parseBody = (a: A): B[] => {return parse<B[]>(a);}
  ```  
  
  
+ lift is a curried version of a map:
```
lift: <A, B>(f: (a: A) => B) => ((fa: F<A>) => F<B>)
map: <A, B>(fa: F<A>, f: (a: A) => B) => F<B>
```

> "Functors are mappings between categories that preserve the categorical structure, i.e. that preserve identity morphisms and composition.

   > *Definition*

   > A functor is a pair (F, lift) where

   > F is a n-ary type constructor (`n >= 1`) which maps each type X to the type F<X> (mapping between objects)

   > lift is a function with the following signature

   > `lift: <A, B>(f: (a: A) => B) => ((fa: F<A>) => F<B>)" (c)`

   
When he speaks about *n-ary type constructors with `n >= 1`* you can read *typescript generic*.

#### e.g.
a) We've got two functions and want to compose them (call g(f())):
   
```typescript
const f = (a: string): string[] => a.split(',')
const g = (b: string): number => b.length
   ```

To do this, we need to define function that performs mapping:

```typescript
function lift<string, number>(g: (b: string) => number): (fb: Array<string>) => Array<number> {
   return fb => fb.map(g)
}
   ```

and now we can compose them:

```typescript
const value = 'aa,vv,bb,qq,ee';
const result = lift(g)(f(value)); //[2,2,2,2,2]
   ```

b) Same, but side effect is option
   
```typescript
const f = (a: string): Option<number> => isNaN(a) ? none : some(Number(a))
const g = (b: number): string => `${b * 100}%`

function lift<number, string>(g: (b: number) => string): (fb: Option<number>) => Option<string> {
   return fb => (isNone(fb) ? none : some(g(fb.value)))
}
   ```
and composition would be:

```typescript
const value = '0.239';
const result = lift(g)(f(value)); //"23,9%"
   ```

c) Same, but side effect is async (but 100% guarantee it won't fail).

```typescript
const f = (a: string): Option<number> => isNaN(a) ? none : some(Number(a))
const g = (b: number): string => `${b * 100}%`

const f = async (): number => 1;
const g = (b: number): string => `${b * 100}%`

function lift<number, string>(g: (b: number) => string): (fb: Task<number>) => Task<string> {
   return fb => () => fb().then(g)
}
```
and composition would be:

```typescript
const result = lift(g)(f()); //"100%"
```
