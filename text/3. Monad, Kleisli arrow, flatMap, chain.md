# Part three. Monad, Kleisli arrow, flatMap, chain

This is extremely short conspect.

In the first part gcanty talked about composition. The whole program is composition of functions, pure and pure, effectful and pure with 1 argument.
In the second part gcanty talked about application. It helps to compose effectful function and pure function with 2 and more arguments.
In this part he talks about composition of two effectful functions. 

So, there are actually four cases:

| Function f    | Function g    | Composition  |Comment|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----:| ---:|
| pure | pure | g(f()) | usual function calls |
| has side effects| pure and receives one argument | lift(g)(f()) | using Functor |
| has side effects | pure and receives more than one argument | liftAn(g)(f()), where liftA1 = lift | using Applicative |
| has side effects |  has side effects | flatMap(g)(f() | using Monad |

## Monad

Monad is a thing that is needed for composition of two effectful functions.

> **Definition**

> A monad is defined by three things:

> (1) a type constructor M which admits a Functor instance

> (2) a function of with the following signature: `of: <A>(a: A) => HKT<M, A>`

> (3) a function flatMap with the following signature: `flatMap: <A, B>(f: (a: A) => HKT<M, B>) => ((ma: HKT<M, A>) => HKT<M, B>)`

> *Note: recall that the HKT type is the fp-ts way to represent a generic type constructor,
so when you see HKT<M, X> you can think to the type constructor M applied to the type X (i.e. M<X>).*

The functions of and flatMap are required to obey three laws:
```
flatMap(of) ∘ f = f (Left identity)
flatMap(f) ∘ of = f (Right identity)
flatMap(h) ∘ (flatMap(g) ∘ f) = flatMap((flatMap(h) ∘ g)) ∘ f (Associativity)
where f, g, h are all effectful functions and ∘ is the usual function composition.
```
  
##  Kleisli arrow

Kleisli arrow is a synonim for effectful function. There are many images in the article:

## flatMap

flatMap is a combination of flatten and map function. It's needed, because composition of two effectful function always produce such things as M<M<C>>.
  
  e.g. 
  ``` typescript
  const f = (a: number): Option<boolean> = a > 0 ? some(true) : none;
  const g = (a: boolean): Option<string> = a ? some('true') : none;
 // if we need to do composition we'll need map and flatten
  pipe(
    f(1),
    (o: Option<boolean>) => option.map(value => g(value))(o),
    (o: Option<Option<string>>) => option.flatten(o)
  )
  ```
 
  Same for array, either, task and others - we always need to map and flatten.
  
## chain
> In fp-ts the flatMap function is modeled by a variant called chain, which is basically flatMap with the arguments rearranged. 
  Chain can be derived from flatMap (and viceversa)
  
```
  flatMap: <A, B>(f: (a: A) => HKT<M, B>) => ((ma: HKT<M, A>) => HKT<M, B>)
  chain:   <A, B>(ma: HKT<M, A>, f: (a: A) => HKT<M, B>) => HKT<M, B>
```

  ``` typescript
  const f = (a: number): Option<boolean> = a > 0 ? some(true) : none;
  const g = (a: boolean): Option<string> = a ? some('true') : none;
 // now we can use chain for composition
  pipe(
    f(1),
    (o: Option<boolean>) => option.chain(value => g(value))(o)
  )
  ```
