# Part two. Currying, Apply, Applicative, HKT

https://dev.to/gcanti/series/680 - the fp-ts author articles cycle.

This is extremely short conspect.

In the first part gcanty talked about composition. The whole program is composition of functions. There are three cases:

| Function f    | Function g    | Composition  |Comment|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----:| ---:|
| pure | pure | g(f()) | usual function calls |
| has side effects| pure and receives one argument | lift(g)(f()) | using Functor |
| has side effects | pure and receives more than one argument | liftAn(g)(f()), where liftA1 = lift | using Applicative |


## 1. Currying
> Currying is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments into evaluating a sequence of functions, each with a single argument. For example, a function that takes two arguments, one from B and one from C, and produces outputs in D, by currying is translated into a function that takes a single argument from C and produces as outputs functions from B to C.

https://javascript.info/currying-partials:
``` javascript
function curry(func) {
  return function curried(...args) {
    if (args.length >= func.length) {
      return func.apply(this, args);
    } else {
      return function(...args2) {
        return curried.apply(this, args.concat(args2));
      }
    }
  };
  
// usage examples
function sum(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

let curriedSum = curry(sum);

alert( curriedSum(1, 2, 3) ); // 6, still callable normally
alert( curriedSum(1)(2,3) ); // 6, currying of 1st arg
alert( curriedSum(1)(2)(3) ); // 6, full currying
```

## 2. Apply and Applicative

Applicative solves the problem that appear in third row in the table. We want to compose two functions, first one has side effects and second receives more than one argument.

Let's show some example:

``` typescript
// f is 'effectful' (with side effects) function
const f = (a: string): Option<number> => isNan(a) ? none : some(Number(a);
// g is pure function that receives several inputs
const g = (c: string, d: number): string => `${d}: ${c}`;
// The problem: we want to call g(f()). How to do this?
```

To compose function f and g, we need to turn g into one-argument function and then use Functor.

To achieve that function g should be *curried*. Now we have:
``` typescript
const g = (c: string) => (d: number): string  => `${d}: ${c}`;
```
And the only thing that's left is to somehow make all the calls.

gcanty add function ap and the type Apply:

```typescript
interface Apply<F> extends Functor<F> {
  ap: <C, D>(fcd: HKT<F, (c: C) => D>, fc: HKT<F, C>) => HKT<F, D>
}
```

There are scary things written in the article, which say that unpack and ap can be derrived from each other.
```
unpack: <C, D>(fcd: HKT<F, (c: C) => D>) => ((fc: HKT<F, C>) => HKT<F, D>)
ap:     <C, D>(fcd: HKT<F, (c: C) => D>, fc: HKT<F, C>) => HKT<F, D>
```
HKT means "type that is constructed from the given one".

Returning to the example, how we can compose those two functions. Let's take function code from [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts/blob/9da2137efb295b82fb59b7b0c2114f2ceb40a2b5/src/Option.ts#L367)

``` typescript
export const ap: <A>(fa: Option<A>) => <B>(fab: Option<(a: A) => B>) => Option<B> =
      (fa) => 
         (fab) =>
             isNone(fab) ?
             none
             : isNone(fa) ?
                none 
                : some(fab.value(fa.value));

// it's extremely hard to read, so let's try to see how it would work for two pure functions first:
const fPure = (a: string): number =>  isNan(a) ? 1 : Number(a);
const g = (c: string) => (d: number): string => `${d}: ${c}`;
const h = (c: number) => (d: string): string => `${d}: ${c}`;
//with h we can compose:
const fh = h(fPure('123'))('a'); //"a: 123"
// with g we need ap
const apPure: (a: A) => <B>(fab: (a: A) => B) => B = a => fab => fab(a);
const applied: (fab: (a: number) => string) => string = apPure("a"); //it is now function (d: number): string => `${d}: a`
const compositionGF = applied(fPure('123')); //"a: 123"
//or without steps:
const compositionGF = apPure("a")(fPure('123'));

// back to the 'effectful' function
const f = (a: string): Option<number> => isNan(a) ? none : some(Number(a);
const g = (c: string) => (d: number): string => `${d}: ${c}`;

//to their composition
const fa: Option<number> = f('123'); //Option<number
const composition = pipe(
    // lift a function
    O.some(g),
    // apply the first argument
    O.ap(O.some('a')),
    // apply the second argument
    O.ap(fa)
  );
//or if to write in line:
const composition = O.ap(fa)(O.ap(O.some('a'))(O.some(g)));
const composition = O.ap(f('123'))(O.ap(O.some('a'))(O.some(g)));

```

There is an example in [Apply](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Apply.ts.html), it is shows how to use it:

``` typescript
import * as O from 'fp-ts/Option'
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'

const f = (a: string) => (b: number) => (c: boolean) => a + String(b) + String(c)
const fa: O.Option<string> = O.some('s')
const fb: O.Option<number> = O.some(1)
const fc: O.Option<boolean> = O.some(true)

assert.deepStrictEqual(
  pipe(
    // lift a function
    O.some(f),
    // apply the first argument
    O.ap(fa),
    // apply the second argument
    O.ap(fb),
    // apply the third argument
    O.ap(fc)
  ),
  O.some('s1true')
)
```

## Applicative

Application is an extention of Apply that has 'of' function. The 'of' function takes argument of type A and convert is to type F<A>.
  
``` typescript
  interface Applicative<F> extends Apply<F> {
  of: <A>(a: A) => HKT<F, A>
}
```
####  e.g. 
```typescript
// for Option 
of: <A>(a: A): Option<A> => some(a),
// for Array
of: <A>(a: A): Array<A> => [a],
```
